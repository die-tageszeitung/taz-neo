/**
 * This View Model should handle the sates of the drawer and the logo.
 * The corresponding Viewer Fragments (eg [TazViewerFragment]) can listen to the states.
 * [DrawerState] holds following properties:
 * [DrawerState.Open] - the drawer is opened
 * [DrawerState.Closed] - the drawer is closed
 * [DrawerState.isBurger] – whether the logo is the burger icon or not
 * [DrawerState.isHidden] – whether the logo is hidden or not
 * [DrawerState.percentMorphedToBurger] - Float [0,1] indicating how much the logo should be hidden.
