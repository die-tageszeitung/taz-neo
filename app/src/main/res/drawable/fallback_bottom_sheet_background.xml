Normally the background color of material BottomSheets should be set with the `backgroundTint` attribute
as documented at:
https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/docs/components/BottomSheet.md#sheet-attributes

In case of BottomSheets with scrollable content, that contains Views with different background colors,
the normally rounded corners of the BottomSheet will be drawn over by the rectangle background.
As a fallback we can set the background of the topmost View to this drawable and set its
color via backgroundTint.
Furthermore all other views of the scroll area must set a (normally the default) background color.

As a result the BottomSheet will have a rounded corner when the content is scrolled to the top, but
the borders will scroll out of the view with the content and the BottomSheet will get rectangle corners.

For devices running on > API 31 it is possible to set the clipToOutline on the BottomSheets
internal `design_bottom_sheet` container and preserve the rounded corners while scrolling.
In this case it would not be necessary to use this fallback background image.
